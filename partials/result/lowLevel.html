    <h3><b>Low level</b></h3>

    <p>Your answers to the questions indicate you may be experiencing slightly lower than average levels of wellbeing and worth, this could be due to circumstances that are current and temporary in your life. In the meantime don't expect perfection. Good enough is usually good enough. Connect with family friends and neighbours and do fun things and have a good laugh. Re-try the test in a week to see if your levels have improved.</p>
